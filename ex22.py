# LIST OF ALL SYMBOLS SO FAR

#SYMBOL     What It Does
# print     prints a string
#=          names a variable
# %r %s %d  puts a conversion within string to be defined by respective variables
# raw_input() asks for user input. can put prompt in parentheses
# ""        surrounds  a string
# %         placeholder in a string and the symbol preceding what variables you tell the placeholders to be
# from      tells where import should get modules from
# import    imports a module. is followed by module name. (is import itself a module?)
# argv      a module that lets you define variables required for terminal to run script
# """       precedes a block string and is ended with another """. Operates just like a string.
# open()    opens the contents of a file so they can be printed, modified or deleted. Defaults to a "read" mode but can be set so you can write or add to file with 'w' or 'a'
# read()    can be put on the tail of a variable to read contents of a file that has been opened. Can be used with print to see the file content output
# truncate() pretty sure this removes content from a file. it will remove everything past the last line read. If its nothing, it deletes everything
# write()   function that can write to a file if its already been opened. 
# sys       system files i guess. its the variable that tells python to access the core files for useful modules and such
# os.path   a cool module that tells python to search a computer for files based on the operating system you are using. file layout is different in different OS's so you need this
# def       Starts the definition of a new function in a file. consists of function name, the arguments in parentheses, and a colon which is followed by the logic of how the function handles the arguments
# +=        used with integers in variables. It makes the integer value go up by whatever value += is set to. Works kind of like = except it means additional to what the variable already means
# return    used within a function to do an equation based on its arguments and 
# True      can be assigned to variables like a boolean status
# False     can be assigned to variables like a boolean status
# +         used to add integers and strings together. in the case of strings it puts them all together in the order you write them
# - / *     subtract divide multiply
