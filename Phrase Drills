Phrase Drills

Next I have a list of Python code snippets on the left, and the English sentences for them:

class X(Y)
"Make a class named X that is-a Y."

class X(object): def __init__(self, J)
"class X has-a __init__ that takes self and J parameters."

class X(object): def M(self, J)
"class X has-a function named M that takes self and J parameters."

foo = X()
"Set foo to an instance of class X."

foo.M(J)
"From foo get the M function, and call it with parameters self, J."

foo.K = Q
"From foo get the K attribute and set it to Q."


In each of these where you see X, Y, M, J, K, Q, and foo you can treat those like blank spots. For example, I can also write these sentences as follows:

"Make a class named ??? that is-a Y."

"class ??? has-a __init__ that takes self and ??? parameters."

"class ??? has-a function named ??? that takes self and ??? parameters."

"Set foo to an instance of class ???."

"From foo get the ??? function, and call it with self=??? and parameters ???."

"From foo get the ??? attribute and set it to ???."
